I'm not even entirely sure what that means, because, does anyone truly know who they are and what they represent? Enough to brand themselves? It all seems rather pompous to me, but here we are. Luckily, the handle <bold id="brand">hileahrious</bold> has been 'mine' for over a decade now, so at least I have that going for me.	</p>	<p>This page will contain several elements of what I believe make up who I am if I had to brand me. Within, you may find any of, but not limited to, the following:		<ul>			<li>existential musings (text posts i suppose)</li>			<li>recommended reading (books)</li>			<li>a safe space for introverts</li> <!-- maybe i offer like a forum or something idk -->			<li>some of my photography or other art</li>			<li>i hope a few puns</li>			<li>and beyond...</li>		</ul>	</p>	<p>And most importantly, all of this with a humorous twist (hence hileahrious).</p>	<!-- <p>The content of my page will likely be indicated in a navigation bar, which will lead to the aforementioned topics, yet also be visible as image categories in geometric boxes </p> -->		<br>		<p id="contact">(Contact me)<br>Learn more about avocados <a href="mailto:leah.ellins@ie.edu?subject=hey leah nice to meet ya">here</a>.</p>		</body></html>
